Challenge time! You are going to use what you've learned so far to solve the famous FizzBuzz Coding Challenge. The challenge is one of the most common coding interview questions.

Here's the FizzBuzz challenge.

Create a new file called fizzbuzz.py:

# Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
# But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
# and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
# For numbers that are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

# Tip: % (modulo) tells you what's left over when you divide one number by another
# ex. number % 3 == 0
