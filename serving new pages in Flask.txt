Now that we have our homepage up and running, it's time to add a second page. Let's call this one "About." In order to get a second-page working, we'll need to update the route, and create a new HTML file.

In this lesson, we set up a second route for our new page "about.html" 

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return render_template("index.html")

@app.route("/")
def about():
    return render_template("about.html")
