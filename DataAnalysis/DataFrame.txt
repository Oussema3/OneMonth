So far, we've been using a data structure from the Pandas library called a DataFrame. According to the documentation, a DataFrame is a two-dimensional size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns). In simpler words, DataFrames are the tables we see when pandas runs our data. Underneath, a DataFrame is just a Python dictionary with lists inside of it. We look at how to create a DataFrame from scratch.

The tables that we see when pandas runs our data are called data frames. But all data frames really are, is a Python dictionary with lists inside of it. You can create data frames from scratch if you want. Like, say, this one:

Create a dictionary
sample_data = {
   'tv': [230.1, 44.5, 17.2],
      'radio': [37.8, 39.3, 45.9],
         'news': [69.2, 45.1, 69.3],
	    'sales': [22.1, 10.4, 9.3]
	    }

Pass in sample_data
data2 = pd.DataFrame(sample_data)
Display the new data
data2
Remember, its not in order because dictionaries do not guarantee an order

If you want to delete the data2 frame?

del data2
