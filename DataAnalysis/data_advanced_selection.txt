In this lesson, we go over even more data selection! We look at various ways to get more specific with the data we are working with.

You can get even more specific with the data your working with. For instance, if we wanted to look at all the data from after a particular year, we could specify 

data[data['year'] > 1995]
How this works under the hood: if we were to only do the inside part, it would only return False/True, and basically just tell you if a film was made before or after 1995. But when you put that inside another data selection, it will only return the true values. 

You can also find films from a particular year by using another one of our boolean friends: 

data[data['year'] == 1966]
We can also grab a range with 

data[(data['year'] > 1995) & (data['year'] < 2000)]
Note that the & works for and, and if you want to use an or, you have to use |. But that latter one is less useful because every movie was made either before or after a given year. 

We can get super specific with this. For instance, if we want to know the top 10 rated movies in a given span of years, we can run: 

data[(data['year'] > 1995) & (data['year'] < 2000)].sort_values(by='rating', ascending=False).head(10) 
That will give us the top rated movies from 1996 through 1999.
