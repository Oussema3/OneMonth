Pandas enables you to export data to a file. You can configure how you want the data saved by specifying such settings as the file name, file type (e.g. .csv or .txt), separators (CSV files use commas), etc.

Let's create another markdown column # Exporting Data, and explore how exporting works.

The function we run to export data is data.to_csv('filename'), where 'filename' is the name of the file you want to save your data as.

You can specify farther for your header, index, and separators (remember csv files are separated by commas).



data.to_csv('test.csv', header=True, index=True, sep=',')


You now have a file you've converted a .txt file to a .csv file. Which is pretty cool. But with Python, we can do all sorts of other things to our data as well.
