To analyze data, we are going to need to learn pandas â€”an open source Python Data Analysis Library. In this pandas tutorial, we'll import data, and then you'll learn Python best-practices for parsing and structuring data.
So now, let's explore some of what Jupyter Notebook can do. Open Jupyter Notebook with the command:

$ jupyter notebook
Once you've got it open:

Click "New" and create a new file named data_analysis_intro

We'll start by adding some text in markdown (if you want to learn more about markdown, here's a handy-dandy markdown cheat sheet). Once we've typed our header: #Import Pandas, we can go out and get pandas.... the Python data analysis library, not the endangered animal.

Shift+Enter will run the file.
Now that we have pandas, we'll create another section called # Importing Data. From there, you can take the data file of imdb top films and pass it through Pandas.
pd.read_csv('imdb_top_10000.txt')
Now, you'll note that pandas has specified a csv (comma separated value) file, which is basically like an excel sheet. Our imdb file is a .txt file separated by tabs, so you'll have to specify the separator. To do this, you can simply add sep="\t"

pd.read_csv('imdb_top_10000.txt', sep="\t")
 Now, =when you run it, you should see a table of films.

Next step for this particular file is to add headers for our table:

####
names = ['id','title','year','rating','votes','length','genres']
data = pd.read_csv('imdb_top_10000.txt', sep="\t", names=names, index_col=0)
####
