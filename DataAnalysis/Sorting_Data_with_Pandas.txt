Let's learn how to sort our data. For this, you use the data.sort_values(by='') function. Whatever is between the quotes represents the column you want to sort by. You can also specify the order you want the sorted data in by passing in an argument: ascending=False or ascending=True.

There's an easy function that will help us sort our data: data.sort_values(by='')- with whatever is in between quotes representing a column we want to work with. If we were to run sort by rating, our table would display starting with the lowest ratings.

If we wanted to look at the highest rating first, we would have to add the argument:
######

data.sort_values(by='rating', ascending=False)
