In your coding journey, a common task that you will perform with your code is accessing APIs (Application Programming Interface). APIs provide a way for two applications to communicate with each other. You will most often use APIs to access some data or to integrate an application with you're own. In this lesson, we use the Dark Sky API to access weather forecast information.

1. Update â€” Use Our API Key: 
As of April 2020, Dark Sky is no longer accepting new API key signups. Therefore, you will need to use One Month's API key for this lesson:

2. Find the current temperature where you live using Python code 
from darksky.api import DarkSky
from darksky.types import languages, units, weather


API_KEY = 'e2fea81b36c2588f1315c4ad2b721989'

darksky = DarkSky(API_KEY)

latitude = 42.3601
longitude = -71.0589
forecast = darksky.get_forecast(
    latitude, longitude,
    extend=False, # default `False`
    lang=languages.ENGLISH, # default `ENGLISH`
    units=units.AUTO, # default `auto`
    exclude=[weather.MINUTELY, weather.ALERTS] # default `[]`
)

print(forecast.currently.temperature)

forecast.latitude # 42.3601
forecast.longitude # -71.0589
forecast.timezone # timezone for coordinates. For exmaple: `America/New_York`

forecast.currently # CurrentlyForecast. Can be finded at darksky/forecast.py
forecast.minutely # MinutelyForecast. Can be finded at darksky/forecast.py
forecast.hourly # HourlyForecast. Can be finded at darksky/forecast.py
forecast.daily # DailyForecast. Can be finded at darksky/forecast.py
forecast.alerts # [Alert]. Can be finded at darksky/forecast.py
